This repo contains the sources for the Nimrod by Example book.

Builds are done manually, and if you'd like to have syntax highlighting, either
grab the modified, linux-only version of the Gitbook Editor [here](http://www.mediafire.com/download/p8qvm1w5t3dfvm4/gitbook-editor-linux.7z),
or get a copy of the modifed highlighting.js module [here](http://www.mediafire.com/download/c37n1q6bcvd950k/modified-highligh.7z),
which can be installed into the appropriate `node_modules` directory
